# cricket-field-setup
a simple app for your cricket team to manage the field positions for each bowler

This webapp was built in one night to help my team's bowlers setup their field positions. After login, user will see an image of cricket field with all possible field positions, which can be selected by click. User can save his field setup, and everyone will be able to see their field setup.
